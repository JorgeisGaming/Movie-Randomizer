# Movie-Randomizer

This R script takes downloaded movie watchlist and randomizes the list, giving me 10 outputs to help me decide what movie to watch based on my watchlist. There's also some conditions, if I wanna choose the movie based on year it was released or by how long they've been sitting in the watchlist
